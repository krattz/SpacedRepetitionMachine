Google Books is pretty cool. You can upload or buy books and then read them on your computer or mobile device. You can highlight and add notes to parts of the text that you want to remember.

When you do this then Google saves the highlights and notes in your Google Drive in the form of a Google doc (one doc per book). You can see what text you highlighted, what you said about it and when you highlighted it.

Try it. Itâ€™s pretty easy and useful.

Your mission is to write an app that has only one page. Whenever you refresh your page it should display a random note. Your app should be fast enough to be user-friendly.
